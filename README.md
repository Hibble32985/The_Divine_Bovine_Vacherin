# Challenge 5

For this challenge we are requested to meet the needs of an employee with an incredibly busy schedule that requires being acutely aware of the responsibilities for any event each day.  Specific details are necessary such as day, date, span of task, color coding to reflect status and easy entry of information.

This will assist considerably to add important events to what effectively is a daily planner facilitating effective time management on a daily basis.

To satisfy the employee's specific needs, this planner must be daily in order to determine what tasks or activities are to occur or be considered on any given day.  This will essentially create a visible, persistently existing schedule for each day.

The planner must have specific characteristics in order to be properly functional for the employee's needs.  For example, upon opening the planner, immediately the current day and date is displayed plainly and easily visible at the top of the calendar page. 
 As well, it must have the feature of when the text is scrolled down it will reflect time periods that can be marked to display time blocks for tasks and activities.  The calendar planner must reflect the specific work day the employee has daily which will be from 9am to 5pm.

Blocks will indicate the span of any given task or activity.  They will be color-coded to define whether an entry occurred in the past, is in the present or meant for future consideration.  Upon selecting a time block by clicking on it an entry can be done immediatley and easily without having to scroll or move to another section.  In addition, following this action, an entry can be saved to indicate the time blocked by clicking on a "save" button which will retain the entry in local storage.  Each time the calendar planner site is refreshed and re-rendered, the saved event will remain and be accessible.
